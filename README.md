# PeakProofADK
An SwiftUI iOS application tracking completion progress of hiking the 46 High Peaks in the Adirondack Mountains.
Users can utilize Apple Maps to find the location of each peak, with photos and descriptions of each peak. 
Users can also prove that they hiked the mountain by scanning a hypothetical QR Code using a built in reader that is available at the top of each peak.
If I were to really publish this application, I would make sure that the app uses an NFC Scanner to scan a small NFC token that would be at the peak, that way, no one can just take a picture of the QR code and share it.  In this way, users would actually have to hike to the peak in order to earn a badge, and prove they made it to the top. 

This was the final project for an iOS Programming course at RIT.
